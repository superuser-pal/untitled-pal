# Review/Retrospective Pattern - Personal Automation Framework
# Adapted from BMM retrospective workflow on 2025-12-22

This pattern shows how to conduct personal reviews and retrospectives - adapted from BMAD's epic retrospective.

## Concept: From Epic Retrospective to Personal Review

**Software Development (BMM):**
- Reviews completed epic (set of stories)
- Team discussion of what went well/poorly
- Extract lessons learned
- Plan improvements for next epic

**Personal Life (Adapted):**
- Reviews completed period (week/month/quarter)
- Self-reflection on what worked/didn't
- Extract lessons and insights
- Plan adjustments for next period

## Review Types

### 1. Weekly Review
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Frequency:** End of week (Sunday evening)
**Scope:** Past 7 days

**Questions:**
- What did I accomplish this week?
- What didn't get done? Why?
- What worked well?
- What struggled?
- What do I want to change next week?

### 2. Monthly Review
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Frequency:** Last day of month
**Scope:** Past month

**Questions:**
- What goals did I complete?
- What goals are in progress?
- What goals stalled? Why?
- What surprised me this month?
- What patterns emerged?
- What do I want to focus on next month?

### 3. Quarterly Review
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Frequency:** End of quarter
**Scope:** Past 3 months

**Questions:**
- What were my biggest wins?
- What were my biggest learnings?
- What didn't work? What will I stop doing?
- What do I want to start doing?
- How am I tracking toward annual goals?

### 4. Annual Review
**Duration:** Half day to full day
**Frequency:** End of year
**Scope:** Full year

**Questions:**
- What am I most proud of this year?
- What would I do differently?
- What did I learn about myself?
- What relationships did I strengthen?
- What goals did I achieve?
- What do I want next year to be about?

## Integration with Agents

### Schedule Optimizer Agent
Facilitates reviews, asks reflection questions, surfaces insights

### Finance Manager Agent
Joins financial reviews, provides budget context

### Health Tracker Agent
Joins health reviews, provides fitness/nutrition context

### Party Mode Review
Multiple agents review together:
```
Alex (Schedule Optimizer): "Let's review your month, {user_name}."
Sofia (Finance Manager): "I'll cover the financial goals."
Dr. Ava (Health Coach): "And I'll review health progress."
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Schedule Regular Reviews
- Weekly: Sunday evening, 15-30 min
- Monthly: Last day of month, 1 hour
- Quarterly: End of quarter, 2-3 hours
- Annual: End of year, half day

### 2. Be Honest
- No sugarcoating
- Acknowledge failures
- Celebrate wins
- Focus on learning

### 3. Look for Patterns
- What's consistently working?
- What's consistently failing?
- Why?

### 4. Make It Actionable
- Extract specific changes
- Update goals based on insights
- Commit to 1-3 key adjustments

### 5. Track Over Time
- Keep review documents
- Compare month-to-month
- Notice long-term trends

## Variations

### Quick Weekly Check-In (10 min)
```
1. What went well this week?
2. What didn't go well?
3. One thing to change next week?
```

### Deep Quarterly Dive (3 hours)
```
1. Review all 3 monthly reviews
2. Identify quarterly themes
3. Major wins and major lessons
4. Big picture: Am I on track for annual goals?
5. What needs to radically change?
```

### Life Area Reviews
Focus on specific domains:
- **Financial Review:** Budget, savings, spending, debt
- **Health Review:** Fitness, nutrition, sleep, mental health
- **Career Review:** Skills, projects, growth, satisfaction
- **Relationship Review:** Family, friends, partner, networking

## Summary

Personal reviews provide:
- ✅ Regular reflection and learning
- ✅ Course correction opportunities
- ✅ Pattern recognition over time
- ✅ Accountability and progress tracking
- ✅ Continuous improvement mindset

Use this pattern for any periodic review (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual).
