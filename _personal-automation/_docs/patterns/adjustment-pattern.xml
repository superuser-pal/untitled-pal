# Mid-Cycle Adjustment Pattern - Personal Automation Framework
# Adapted from BMM correct-course workflow on 2025-12-22

This pattern shows how to handle mid-cycle adjustments when things go off track - adapted from BMAD's course correction workflow.

## Concept: From Sprint Correction to Life Adjustment

**Software Development (BMM):**
- Mid-sprint course correction when things derail
- Analyzes what went wrong
- Proposes solutions
- Adjusts sprint plan

**Personal Life (Adapted):**
- Mid-week/mid-month adjustment when off track
- Analyzes what's not working
- Proposes solutions
- Adjusts goals/habits/schedule

## When to Use Course Correction

### Trigger Events
1. **Major Life Change**
   - New job, move, relationship change
   - Health issue or injury
   - Unexpected financial situation

2. **Persistent Struggle**
   - Same goal failing 2+ weeks in a row
   - Habit streak broken repeatedly
   - Consistent lack of progress

3. **New Information**
   - Learned something that invalidates original plan
   - Discovered better approach mid-way through
   - External factors changed (schedule, budget, etc.)

4. **Feeling Stuck**
   - Not sure what to do next
   - Plan no longer makes sense
   - Overwhelmed or burned out

### Don't Use For
- ❌ Minor setbacks (one missed workout)
- ❌ Normal fluctuations (bad day)
- ❌ Scheduled reviews (use retrospective pattern)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Problem:** {{root_cause}}

**Details:** {{problem_details}}

<step n="4" goal="Generate Solution Options">
  <output>

  </output>

  <action>Based on {{problem_type}}, generate 3-4 solution options</action>

  <check if="{{problem_type}} == TIME">
    <output>
**Option 1: Reduce Scope**
- Cut the goal in half (e.g., 3 workouts/week → 2 workouts/week)
- Pros: More realistic, likely to succeed
- Cons: Slower progress

**Option 2: Remove Conflicting Commitment**
- Identify what's eating your time and cut it
- Example: {{time_drain}} - can you reduce or eliminate this?
- Pros: Creates space for your goal
- Cons: May require difficult choices

**Option 3: Reschedule Goal**
- Move goal to next month when you have more time
- Pros: Removes pressure now
- Cons: Delays progress

**Option 4: Combine Activities**
- Can you stack this goal with something else?
- Example: Listen to course while commuting
- Pros: Efficient use of time
- Cons: May not work for all goals
    </output>
  </check>

  <check if="{{problem_type}} == ENERGY">
    <output>
**Option 1: Change Timing**
- Work on this goal when you have most energy
- If you're drained at night, try morning
- Pros: Leverages peak energy
- Cons: May conflict with existing schedule

**Option 2: Reduce Intensity**
- Make it easier (e.g., 30-min workout → 15-min workout)
- Pros: Lower barrier to entry
- Cons: Less dramatic results

**Option 3: Fix Energy Source**
- Address why you're depleted (sleep, stress, diet)
- Pros: Fixes root issue
- Cons: Takes time to see results

**Option 4: Batch Activities**
- Do this goal once/week with high focus vs. daily while tired
- Pros: One high-energy session
- Cons: Less frequent practice
    </output>
  </check>

  <check if="{{problem_type}} == MOTIVATION">
    <output>
**Option 1: Revisit the Why**
- Reconnect with original purpose
- Visualize benefits of completing this goal
- Pros: May reignite motivation
- Cons: May reveal goal isn't actually important

**Option 2: Change the Approach**
- Keep the outcome, change the method
- Example: Hate gym? Try home workouts or sports
- Pros: More enjoyable path
- Cons: Learning curve for new approach

**Option 3: Add Accountability**
- Tell someone, join a group, post progress
- Pros: External motivation
- Cons: Pressure may backfire

**Option 4: Abandon Goal**
- If it doesn't matter anymore, let it go
- Pros: Frees mental space
- Cons: Feels like failure (but sometimes it's wisdom)
    </output>
  </check>

  <check if="{{problem_type}} == EXTERNAL BLOCKER">
    <output>
**Option 1: Remove the Blocker**
- If blocker is: {{external_blocker}}
- Can you eliminate it or work around it?
- Pros: Clears the path
- Cons: May not be within your control

**Option 2: Adapt Goal to Blocker**
- Example: Gym closed? Do home workouts
- Pros: Maintains progress
- Cons: May not be ideal

**Option 3: Pause Until Blocker Resolves**
- Set goal to "paused" status
- Revisit when blocker is gone
- Pros: Honest about constraints
- Cons: Momentum lost

**Option 4: Escalate**
- If blocker is someone/something you can influence, address it
- Pros: May permanently remove obstacle
- Cons: May create conflict

## Common Adjustment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Overcommitted

**Trigger:** "I have too many goals and I'm making no progress on any of them"

**Root Cause:** TIME - trying to do too much

**Solution:** Cut 50% of goals, focus on top 2-3

**Action:**
1. Rank goals by importance
2. Pause bottom 50%
3. Update goal-status.yaml
4. Revisit paused goals next month

### Scenario 2: Wrong Approach

**Trigger:** "I hate going to the gym, I keep skipping workouts"

**Root Cause:** MOTIVATION - method doesn't fit preferences

**Solution:** Change approach from gym to home workouts or sports

**Action:**
1. Research home workout programs
2. Try 3 options this week
3. Pick one and commit
4. Update goal from "gym 3x/week" to "workout 3x/week (home)"

### Scenario 3: External Blocker

**Trigger:** "My work schedule changed and I no longer have evenings free"

**Root Cause:** EXTERNAL BLOCKER - schedule shift

**Solution:** Move evening goals to morning or weekends

**Action:**
1. Identify which goals were evening-based
2. Test morning alternatives this week
3. Update goal timing in schedule
4. Adjust expectations if needed

### Scenario 4: Energy Mismatch

**Trigger:** "I'm exhausted after work and can't do my course"

**Root Cause:** ENERGY - trying to learn when depleted

**Solution:** Move learning to weekend mornings when fresh

**Action:**
1. Block Saturday/Sunday mornings for course
2. Reduce frequency from 5x/week to 2x/week (weekends)
3. Accept slower progress but higher quality

## Integration with Other Patterns

### 1. Triggers Review
Course correction often reveals issues to discuss in next retrospective

### 2. Updates Goal Status
Directly modifies goal-status.yaml

### 3. Informs Planning
Adjustments should influence next period's goals

## Best Practices

### 1. Don't Overuse
- Not for minor setbacks
- Reserve for significant issues
- 1-2 per month max

### 2. Be Honest
- No shame in adjusting
- Rigidity leads to failure
- Flexibility leads to success

### 3. Document Why
- Track trigger, cause, solution
- Learn from patterns over time
- Review adjustments in retrospectives

### 4. Follow Through
- Actually implement the solution
- Check in 1 week later
- Iterate if needed

### 5. Question the Goal
- Sometimes the goal itself is wrong
- Be willing to abandon
- Sunk cost fallacy is real

## Agent Integration

### Schedule Optimizer Agent
Facilitates course correction, proposes solutions

### Finance Manager Agent
Joins if financial goals affected

### Health Tracker Agent
Joins if health goals affected

### Party Mode Adjustment
Multiple agents help diagnose and solve:
```
Alex (Schedule Optimizer): "Let's figure out why this isn't working, {user_name}."
Sofia (Finance Manager): "If it's money-related, I can help adjust the budget."
Dr. Ava (Health Coach): "Or if it's energy, we can look at your recovery."
```

## Summary

Mid-cycle adjustments enable:
- ✅ Quick recovery from derailments
- ✅ Flexible, adaptive goal pursuit
- ✅ Learning what works/doesn't
- ✅ Preventing total abandonment
- ✅ Maintaining momentum despite setbacks

Use this pattern when you need to change course mid-period, not at scheduled review times.
