# Team Collaboration Pattern - Personal Automation Framework
# Extracted from BMAD teams on 2025-12-22

This pattern shows how to configure multi-agent teams for collaborative discussions.

## Team YAML Structure

```yaml
# <!-- Powered by BMAD-CORE™ -->
bundle:
  name: Team Display Name
  icon: 🚀
  description: Brief description of when to use this team
agents:
  - agent-id-1
  - agent-id-2
  - agent-id-3
party: "./default-party.csv"  # Optional: Party mode configuration
```

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Required | Purpose | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `bundle.name` | ✅ Yes | Team display name | "Financial Planning Team" |
| `bundle.icon` | ⚠️ Optional | Team emoji | "💰" |
| `bundle.description` | ✅ Yes | When to use this team | "Team for budgeting, investments, and financial decisions" |
| `agents` | ✅ Yes | List of agent IDs | ["finance-manager", "career-advisor"] |

## Party Mode Integration

### What is Party Mode?

Party mode enables multiple agents to:
1. Discuss a user's question collaboratively
2. Provide diverse perspectives
3. Reach consensus or surface trade-offs
4. Make holistic recommendations

### How Party Mode Works

1. User activates party mode (via agent menu or directly)
2. User selects which agents to invite (or uses pre-configured team)
3. User asks a question
4. Each agent responds with their perspective
5. Agents discuss and debate
6. User gets comprehensive, multi-faceted advice

### default-party.csv Structure

```csv
agent_id,agent_name,agent_role
finance-manager,Sofia,Personal Finance Advisor
health-tracker,Dr. Ava,Health & Wellness Coach
schedule-optimizer,Alex,Productivity & Time Management Expert
email-processor,Elena,Email Productivity Specialist
career-advisor,Marcus,Career Development Strategist
```

This CSV defines:
- `agent_id`: Must match agent file names
- `agent_name`: Agent's first name (used in dialogue)
- `agent_role`: Role title (used in dialogue format)

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Loading a Team

When a user wants multi-agent advice, they can:

```
User: "I want to discuss whether I should quit my job"
Claude: "This is a big decision. Let me bring in the Life Balance Team."
[Loads: finance-manager, career-advisor, schedule-optimizer]
```

### Pattern 2: Team Dialogue Format

All agents must use consistent format:

```
Sofia (Personal Finance Advisor): "Let's look at the financial impact first, {user_name}. What's your current monthly income?"

Marcus (Career Development Strategist): "Before we jump into numbers, I want to understand - what's driving this decision? Career growth, work-life balance, or something else?"

{user_name}: [user responds]

Alex (Productivity Specialist): "Good question, Marcus. {user_name}, have you considered whether this is a time management issue or truly a job fit issue?"
```

**Format:** `Name (Role): "dialogue"`

### Pattern 3: Decision Framework

Teams should:
1. **Gather Information** - Each agent asks relevant questions
2. **Share Perspectives** - Each agent presents their viewpoint
3. **Surface Trade-offs** - Agents discuss conflicts/tensions
4. **Reach Recommendation** - Team summarizes options
5. **User Decides** - User makes final call with full context

## Team Composition Guidelines

### Small Team (2-3 agents)
**Best for:** Focused decisions with clear domains
- Example: Finance + Health for "Should I buy a Peloton?"
- Example: Email + Schedule for "How do I process my inbox better?"

### Medium Team (3-4 agents)
**Best for:** Multi-faceted life decisions
- Example: Finance + Health + Schedule + Career for "Should I work remotely?"
- Example: Finance + Email + Schedule for "Should I start a side business?"

### Large Team (5+ agents)
**Best for:** Major life changes
- Example: All agents for "Should I move to a new city?"
- Example: All agents for "How should I structure my year?"

## Creating New Teams

### Step 1: Identify Use Case
What decisions will this team help with?

### Step 2: Select Agents
Which agent perspectives are needed?

### Step 3: Create Team File
Save as: `_personal-automation/{module}/teams/team-{name}.yaml`

```yaml
bundle:
  name: {Team Name}
  icon: {emoji}
  description: {When to use this team}
agents:
  - {agent-id-1}
  - {agent-id-2}
  - {agent-id-3}
party: "./default-party.csv"
```

### Step 4: Document Team Purpose
Add README or comments explaining:
- When to use this team
- What kinds of questions work best
- Example scenarios

## Integration with Party Mode Workflow

Teams can be loaded via:

1. **Direct Selection**
   ```
   User: "Load the Financial Planning Team"
   ```

2. **Agent Menu**
   ```xml
   <item cmd="*financial-team" exec="{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/teams/team-financial.yaml">
     Discuss with Financial Planning Team
   </item>
   ```

3. **Party Mode Auto-Suggest**
   ```
   User: "Should I buy a house?"
   Claude: "This is a complex decision. I recommend the Life Balance Team (Finance, Career, Schedule). Should I load them?"
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Teams Focused**
   - 2-5 agents per team
   - Clear purpose for each team
   - Don't create overlapping teams

2. **Name Teams Clearly**
   - Use descriptive names: "Financial Planning Team", not "Team 1"
   - Icon should match purpose

3. **Document Use Cases**
   - Description should explain WHEN to use
   - Provide example questions

4. **Balance Perspectives**
   - Include complementary viewpoints
   - Avoid redundant agents

5. **Test Dialogue**
   - Ensure agents don't all say the same thing
   - Each agent should add unique value

## Migration Notes

When adapting from BMM teams:

1. **Replace Software Agents**
   - ❌ pm, architect, dev, tea
   - ✅ finance-manager, health-tracker, email-processor

2. **Rename Teams**
   - ❌ "Team Full Stack", "Team Plan and Architect"
   - ✅ "Life Balance Team", "Financial Planning Team"

3. **Update Descriptions**
   - Focus on personal life decisions
   - Remove software development language

4. **Keep Structure**
   - YAML format stays the same
   - Party mode integration unchanged
   - Dialogue format identical

## Example: Full Life Decision

```
User: "Should I quit my job and start a business?"

[Life Balance Team loads: Finance Manager, Career Advisor, Schedule Optimizer]

Sofia (Finance Manager): "Big decision, {user_name}. First question - how many months of expenses do you have saved?"

Marcus (Career Advisor): "And what's the business idea? Is this something you're passionate about, or just escaping a bad job?"

Alex (Schedule Optimizer): "Important point - have you calculated how much time this business will require in the first 6 months?"

{user_name}: "I have 6 months saved. It's a consulting business in my field. Probably 60 hours/week initially."

Sofia: "6 months is decent, but with a 60-hour week, you might need 9-12 months runway. Can you save more first?"

Marcus: "Consulting in your field is lower risk. You have expertise and likely some network. That's a strength."

Alex: "60 hours/week means you'll have almost no time for health, family, or rest. Is that sustainable for you? Or can you start part-time?"

[Discussion continues with user, agents debate trade-offs, surface options]

Marcus: "Here's what I'm hearing - you could:
1. Save for 6 more months, then quit (safer)
2. Start consulting part-time while employed (slower but sustainable)
3. Quit now with strict budget (risky but fast)"

Sofia: "I vote for option 2 - part-time consulting keeps income flowing."

Alex: "Agreed. Option 2 lets you test the business without the time crunch."

{user_name}: "That makes sense. Let me try part-time for 3 months first."

All agents: "Smart decision, {user_name}! Want us to help you plan the first 90 days?"
```

## Summary

Teams enable:
- ✅ Multi-perspective advice
- ✅ Holistic decision-making
- ✅ Debate and discussion
- ✅ Surface trade-offs
- ✅ Better outcomes for complex decisions

Use teams for decisions that span multiple life domains (money + time + health + career).
