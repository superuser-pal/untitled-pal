# Advanced Elicitation Pattern - Personal Automation Framework
# Extracted from BMAD advanced-elicitation.xml on 2025-12-22

This pattern shows how to use 50+ content enhancement techniques to improve any document or decision through intelligent questioning, perspective-shifting, and deep analysis.

## Concept: Content Enhancement Through Structured Techniques

**What it is:**
Advanced elicitation is a library of 50+ methods for enhancing content through structured thinking techniques. It uses a CSV-driven method library with dynamic selection based on context.

**Why it's universal:**
- Works on ANY content (documents, decisions, plans, ideas)
- 50+ techniques spanning 9 categories
- Dynamically selects relevant methods for context
- Iterative enhancement (apply multiple methods)
- Integrates with workflow checkpoints

**Personal automation value:**
- Improve goal setting with First Principles Analysis
- Enhance monthly reviews with Multiple Perspectives
- Refine career plans with Pre-Mortem Analysis
- Deepen budget decisions with Root Cause Analysis
- Brainstorm solutions with Idea Synthesis techniques

    <i>2. Apply elicitation methods iteratively to enhance that specific content</i>
    <i>3. Return the enhanced version back when user selects 'x' to proceed</i>
    <i>4. The enhanced content replaces the original section content in the output document</i>
  </integration>

  <!-- ... (complete flow below) ... -->
</task>
```

## Three-Step Flow

### Step 1: Method Registry Loading

**Goal:** Load technique library and intelligently select 5 relevant methods

**Method Library (CSV):**

```csv
id,category,method_name,description,output_pattern
1,collaboration,Stakeholder Round Table,perspectives → synthesis → alignment
13,advanced,Thread of Thought,context → thread → synthesis
40,core,First Principles Analysis,assumptions → truths → new approach
45,learning,Feynman Technique,complex → simple → gaps → mastery
...50+ more methods
```

**CSV Structure:**
- `category`: Method grouping (core, structural, risk, collaboration, etc.)
- `method_name`: Display name for the method
- `description`: Rich explanation of what the method does, when to use it, and why it's valuable
- `output_pattern`: Flexible flow guide using → arrows (e.g., "analysis → insights → action")

**Context Analysis:**

```
Analyze from conversation history:
- Content type (goal, review, plan, budget, decision)
- Complexity (simple, moderate, complex)
- Stakeholder needs (personal vs. family vs. work)
- Risk level (low, medium, high stakes)
- Creative potential (routine vs. innovative)
```

**Smart Selection Process:**

```
1. Analyze context: Content type, complexity, stakeholder needs, risk, creativity
2. Parse descriptions: Understand each method's purpose from CSV descriptions
3. Select 5 methods: Choose methods that best match the context
4. Balance approach: Mix of foundational and specialized techniques
```

**Example selection for monthly budget review:**
```
Context: Financial decision, moderate complexity, low risk, personal stakeholder

Selected methods:
1. First Principles Analysis (core) - Question budget assumptions
2. Gap Analysis (foundational) - Find spending vs. income gaps
3. Stakeholder Round Table (collaboration) - Consider family perspectives
4. Scenario Planning (scenario) - What-if analysis for next month
5. Pattern Recognition (advanced) - Identify spending trends
```

### Step 2: Present Options and Handle Responses

**Interactive Menu Format:**

```
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (1-5), [r] to Reshuffle, [a] List All, or [x] to Proceed:

1. First Principles Analysis
2. Gap Analysis
3. Stakeholder Round Table
4. Scenario Planning
5. Pattern Recognition
r. Reshuffle the list with 5 new options
a. List all methods with descriptions
x. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

**Case: User selects 1-5 (Apply method)**

```
1. Execute the selected method using its description from the CSV
2. Adapt the method's complexity and output format based on context
3. Apply the method creatively to the current section content being enhanced
4. Display the enhanced version showing what the method revealed or improved
5. CRITICAL: Ask user if they would like to apply the changes (y/n/other) and HALT
6. ONLY if Yes, apply the changes. IF No, discard. If other, follow user instructions.
7. CRITICAL: Re-present the same 1-5,r,x prompt to allow additional elicitations
```

**Case: User selects 'r' (Reshuffle)**

```
1. Select 5 random methods from advanced-elicitation-methods.csv
2. Try to pick a diverse set of methods covering different categories and approaches
3. Prioritize 1 and 2 as potentially most useful for the document or section
4. Present new list with same prompt format
```

**Case: User selects 'x' (Exit)**

```
1. Complete elicitation and proceed
2. Return the fully enhanced content back to workflow
3. The enhanced content becomes the final version for that section
4. Signal completion to continue with next section
```

**Case: User selects 'a' (List all methods)**

```
1. List all methods with their descriptions from the CSV in a compact table
2. Allow user to select any method by name or number from the full list
3. After selection, execute the method as described in case 1-5 above
```

**Case: User provides direct feedback**

```
1. Apply changes to current section content based on user input
2. Re-present choices
```

**Case: User selects multiple numbers (e.g., "1, 3, 5")**

```
1. Execute methods in sequence on the content
2. Re-offer choices after all executed
```

### Step 3: Execution Guidelines

**Method Execution Principles:**

```
1. Use the description from CSV to understand and apply each method
2. Use the output_pattern as a flexible guide (e.g., "paths → evaluation → selection")
3. Adapt complexity based on content needs (simple to sophisticated)
4. Interpret methods flexibly based on context while maintaining pattern consistency
5. Focus on actionable insights
6. Tie elicitation to specific content being analyzed
7. Identify personas for multi-perspective methods
8. Use party members if available in memory
```

**Critical Loop Behavior:**

```
- Always re-offer the 1-5,r,a,x choices after each method execution
- Continue until user selects 'x' to proceed with enhanced content
- Confirm or ask user what should be accepted from the session
- Each method application builds upon previous enhancements
```

**Content Preservation:**

```
- Track all enhancements made during elicitation
- Iterative enhancement: Each selected method (1-5) should:
  1. Apply to the current enhanced version of the content
  2. Show the improvements made
  3. Return to the prompt for additional elicitations or completion
```

**Context:** You've drafted your monthly review and want to go deeper.

**Workflow integration:**
```xml
<step n="3" goal="Review goals">
  <template-output target="{{review_file}}" show="user">
## Goal Progress

This month I completed 3 out of 5 goals. Workouts were consistent but budget overspent on dining.
  </template-output>
</step>

User selects: [a] Advanced Elicitation

Advanced Elicitation presents:
1. Root Cause Analysis (core)
2. Pattern Recognition (advanced)
3. Pre-Mortem Analysis (scenario)
4. Gap Analysis (structural)
5. First Principles Analysis (core)

User selects: 1 (Root Cause Analysis)
```

**Agent applies Root Cause Analysis:**

```
Original: "Budget overspent on dining"

Agent: "Let's find the root cause. Why did you overspend on dining?"
User: "Had more work dinners than expected"
Agent: "Why were there more work dinners?"
User: "New project with evening meetings"
Agent: "Why do evening meetings lead to dining out?"
User: "Too tired to cook after late meetings"
Agent: "So the root cause is: Evening meetings → tiredness → dining out"

Enhanced version:
## Goal Progress - Budget

**Issue:** Budget overspent on dining by $200 (40% over)

**Root Cause:** New project created evening meetings 3x/week
→ Too tired to cook after 8pm meetings
→ Ordered delivery or dined out

**Solution:** Not a willpower issue, it's a schedule issue. Options:
1. Meal prep on weekends for late-night meals
2. Budget for project-related dining (separate category)
3. Bring easy-to-eat meals to office for post-meeting dinners

Agent: "Apply these changes? (y/n/other)"
User: y

[Content updated, menu re-appears for more elicitation or user selects 'x' to continue]
```

### Use Case 2: Refining Career Goals with First Principles

**Context:** Setting career goals for next year, want to question assumptions.

```
1. First Principles Analysis (core) ← Selected
2. Future Wheel (scenario)
3. Stakeholder Round Table (collaboration)
4. Thread of Thought (advanced)
5. Comparative Analysis (learning)
```

**Agent applies First Principles:**

```
Original career goal: "Get promoted to Senior Engineer"

Agent: "Let's break this down to first principles. Why do you want a promotion?"
User: "More money and recognition"
Agent: "What is money for in your life?"
User: "Financial security and freedom to pursue hobbies"
Agent: "What is recognition for?"
User: "Validation that I'm good at what I do"
Agent: "Are there other ways to achieve financial security and validation?"
User: "Hmm... I could freelance for more money, or contribute to open source for recognition"

Enhanced version:
## Career Goal - Rethinking Promotion

**Assumed goal:** Get promoted to Senior Engineer

**First principles breakdown:**
- Underlying need 1: Financial security ($20K raise expected)
- Underlying need 2: Validation of skills

**Alternative paths to same outcomes:**
1. Promotion (traditional path)
   - Pros: Benefits, stability, clear recognition
   - Cons: Office politics, longer hours, management pressure

2. Freelancing (financial path)
   - Pros: Potentially $30K+ extra, flexibility
   - Cons: Unstable, no benefits, hustle required

3. Open Source + Current Role (recognition path)
   - Pros: Industry validation, skill growth, maintain stability
   - Cons: No immediate financial gain

**Refined goal:** Achieve financial security ($20K increase) AND skill validation through one or more paths - evaluate promotion vs. alternatives by Q1 end.

Agent: "Apply? (y/n/other)"
User: y
```

### Use Case 3: Budget Planning with Scenario Analysis

```
Original weekly review:
Mon: Workout, work 9h, tired
Tue: No workout, work 10h, very tired
Wed: No workout, work 9h, tired
Thu: Workout, work 8h, energized
Fri: Workout, work 8h, energized

Agent analyzes and identifies patterns:

**Pattern 1: Exercise → Energy**
- Days with workouts: 8-9h work, feel energized
- Days without: 9-10h work, feel tired
- Insight: Workouts boost energy and productivity

**Pattern 2: Tuesday Trap**
- Tuesdays consistently: No workout, longest work day, most tired
- Insight: Tuesday is the "overwork day"

**Pattern 3: Thursday Turnaround**
- Workouts resume Thu/Fri after mid-week slump
- Insight: Recover energy end of week

**Recommendations:**
1. Protect Tuesday workout time - critical for preventing overwork
2. Limit Tuesday work to 9h max
3. Schedule important work for Thu/Fri when energy is highest

Enhanced review includes actionable insights from patterns.

Agent: "Apply? (y/n/other)"
User: y
```

## Integration with Workflows

### Pattern 1: Checkpoint Enhancement

**In any workflow with template-output:**

```xml
<step n="5" goal="Generate recommendations">
  <template-output target="{{output_file}}" show="user">
## Recommendations

Based on your progress this month, here are my recommendations:
1. Continue current workout schedule
2. Reduce dining budget by $100
3. Focus on savings goal
  </template-output>
</step>

<!-- User sees content, selects [a] Advanced Elicitation -->

Advanced Elicitation options appear:
1. Pre-Mortem Analysis - Imagine these recommendations failing, why?
2. Stakeholder Round Table - Consider family impact
3. Scenario Planning - What if income changes?
4. First Principles - Question the underlying goals
5. Gap Analysis - What's missing from recommendations?

<!-- User enhances content, then continues workflow -->
```

### Pattern 2: Standalone Elicitation

**Use directly without a workflow:**

```
User: "I want to brainstorm career options using advanced elicitation"

Agent loads method library, presents 5 relevant methods:
1. SCAMPER (creative)
2. Future Wheel (scenario)
3. Stakeholder Round Table (collaboration)
4. Idea Synthesis (creative)
5. Comparative Analysis (learning)

User iteratively applies methods to explore career paths.
```

### Pattern 3: Party Mode Integration

**With agent-party manifest loaded:**

```
Agent: "I've loaded your team from agent-manifest.csv. Party mode members can join elicitation!"

Methods now executed by appropriate agents:
- Financial methods: Sofia (Finance Manager) applies
- Health methods: Dr. Ava (Health Coach) applies
- Career methods: Morgan (Career Advisor) applies
- Schedule methods: Alex (Schedule Optimizer) applies

Multiple perspectives automatically!
```
