# Goal Tracking Pattern - Personal Automation Framework
# Adapted from BMM sprint-status.yaml on 2025-12-22

This pattern shows how to track personal goals, habits, and tasks - adapted from BMAD's sprint-status tracking.

## Concept: From Sprint Status to Goal Status

**Software Development (BMM):**
- Tracks epics, stories, tasks
- Sprint-based (2-week cycles)
- Status: not-started, in-progress, done, blocked

**Personal Life (Adapted):**
- Tracks goals, habits, tasks
- Time-based (weekly/monthly cycles)
- Status: not-started, in-progress, completed, paused

## Integration with Workflows

### Workflow: Check Goal Status

```yaml
name: "check-goal-status"
description: "Review current goal tracking and surface priorities"

config_source: "{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/config.yaml"
goals_folder: "{config_source}:goals_folder"

required_inputs:
  - goal_status: "{goals_folder}/goal-status.yaml"

# Workflow loads YAML, analyzes progress, surfaces:
# - On-track goals (celebrate!)
# - Struggling goals (need attention)
# - Blocked goals (remove blockers)
# - Completed goals (mark done, set new goals)
```

### Workflow: Update Goal Status

```yaml
name: "update-goal-status"
description: "Weekly/monthly update of goal progress"

config_source: "{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/config.yaml"
goals_folder: "{config_source}:goals_folder"

# Workflow prompts user:
# - Which goals made progress?
# - What's the new %?
# - Any new blockers?
# - Any completed tasks?
# - Any new tasks needed?
```

### Workflow: Goal Retrospective

```yaml
name: "goal-retrospective"
description: "End-of-period goal review and lessons learned"

config_source: "{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/config.yaml"
goals_folder: "{config_source}:goals_folder"

# Workflow reviews:
# - What goals completed?
# - What goals missed? Why?
# - What worked well?
# - What to change next period?
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Don't track too many goals (3-5 max per category)
- Don't track everything (focus on what matters)
- Review weekly, update weekly

### 2. Use Status Effectively
- **not-started**: Set but not begun
- **in-progress**: Actively working on it
- **paused**: Temporarily stopped (not abandoned)
- **completed**: Done!
- **abandoned**: Decided not to pursue

### 3. Track Progress Meaningfully
- Use percentages for measurable goals (savings, workouts)
- Use milestone counts for binary goals (course completed: yes/no)
- Use streak counts for habits (days in a row)

### 4. Surface Blockers Early
- Document what's preventing progress
- Assess impact (high/medium/low)
- Create mitigation plans

### 5. Celebrate Wins
- Note completed goals
- Record lessons learned
- Build momentum

## Agent Integration

### Schedule Optimizer Agent
Reads goal-status.yaml to:
- Prioritize tasks based on goal status
- Suggest time blocks for struggling goals
- Identify conflicts between goals

### Finance Manager Agent
Reads goal-status.yaml to:
- Track financial goals (savings, debt, spending)
- Alert on budget impacts
- Suggest reallocations

### Health Tracker Agent
Reads goal-status.yaml to:
- Track fitness and nutrition goals
- Monitor habit streaks
- Suggest adjustments

## Migration from sprint-status.yaml

| Sprint Status | Goal Status |
|---------------|-------------|
| Epic | Goal |
| Story | Task |
| Sprint | Week/Month |
| Velocity | Progress % |
| Blocker | Blocker |
| Retrospective | Review/Reflection |
| Status: done | Status: completed |

## Example Agent Menu Item

```xml
<item cmd="*check-goals" workflow="{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/workflows/goals/check-status/workflow.yaml">
  Review current goal progress
</item>

<item cmd="*update-goals" workflow="{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/workflows/goals/update-status/workflow.yaml">
  Update goal progress for this week
</item>

<item cmd="*goal-review" workflow="{project-root}/_personal-automation/life-management/workflows/goals/monthly-review/workflow.yaml">
  Monthly goal retrospective and planning
</item>
```

## Summary

Goal status tracking provides:
- ✅ Clear visibility into progress
- ✅ Early warning on struggling goals
- ✅ Accountability and momentum
- ✅ Data for retrospectives
- ✅ Foundation for agent decision-making

Use this pattern for any time-boxed goal tracking (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
