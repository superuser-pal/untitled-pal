## PART I: The Business Manifesto (The "Why")

### 1. Our Mission
To bridge the gap between "Black-Box SaaS" and "Complex Coding" by providing a Markdown-first, open-source framework that empowers non-coders to architect their own agentic lives.

### 2. The 10 Commandments
1.  **Markdown is the Master:** Logic must be human-readable and auditable.
2.  **Domain-Driven Sovereignty:** Data is siloed into jurisdictions to prevent context poisoning.
3.  **The IDE is the Cockpit:** Direct file control via Cursor/Claude Code.
4.  **Variables are Truth:** Decouple logic from specific local paths for portability.
5.  **Cost-Efficiency by Design:** Use Micro-Step Patterns to minimize token spend.
6.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** Agents require explicit validation via `<ask>` tags.
7.  **Privacy-First:** Local-first data architecture; no silent API leaks.
8.  **Composable Utility:** Workflows are "Lego bricks" that stack across domains.
9.  **The Master Orchestrator:** One central agent expert in the Protocol, not the data.
10. **Open Contribution:** Scale through verified architectural standards.

### 3. The Credo for Contributors
To have a workflow accepted into the PromptPal core:
* It must follow the `workflow.xml` execution standard.
* It must use standardized data schemas (e.g., `balance.md` for Finance).
* It must include an `instructions.md` with clear `<step>`, `<ask>`, and `<check>` logic.

## PART II: The Master Brief (The "What & How")

### 1. Executive Summary
An open-source "Personal Automation OS" that transforms users from AI consumers into **Digital Sovereigns**.

### 2. The Problem Space
* **Fragmentation:** Data is scattered across isolated tools and tabs.
* **The "Black Box" Barrier:** Automation logic is usually hidden in code, making it impossible for non-coders to audit or fix.
* **Stagnant Context:** Assistants lack persistent, structured memory across different life areas.

### 3. The Solution: "PromptPal Agentic Framework"
* **The "Cockpit" Interface:** Primary control via the IDE with **Heads-Up Displays (HUDs)** (local web-views) for visual telemetry.
* **The Starter Kit:** 8 bootstrap domains (Finance, Email, Project Manager, Health, etc.) designed as blueprints to incentivize users to build their own custom jurisdictions.
* **The Multi-Agent Protocol:** Party Mode for collaborative, cross-domain intelligence.

### 4. The "Hook" Domains (The Starter 3)

#### 💰 Finance: The "Sofia" Model
* **Mission:** Local financial intelligence and ledger maintenance.
* **Primary Workflow:** "Audit my spending and alert me to subscription bloat."

#### 📧 Email: The "Elena" Model
* **Mission:** Local triage officer extracting tasks and sentiment from the inbox.
* **Primary Workflow:** "Draft replies based on my `knowledge/tone-guide.md`."

#### 🏗️ Project Manager: The "Alex" Model
* **Mission:** Orchestrate the lifecycle of complex projects, beginning with dogfooding the PromptPal-Agents repo development.
* **Primary Workflow:** "Sync the development roadmap with current file status and flag blockers."

### 5. Strategic Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Finalize the Constitution and the **Master Orchestrator** agent.
* **Phase 2:** Build the Logic for the **Starter 3** (Finance, Email, Project Manager).
* **Phase 3:** Launch the Contributor Portal and standardize the **Project Manager** into an agnostic template for the community.
* **Phase 4:** Enable HUD templates for Streamlit/React visualization.
